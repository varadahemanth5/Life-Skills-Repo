## Passive Communication Style in your Day-to-Day Life
1. I tend to switch to passive communication when I feel that speaking up might cause conflict, or when the situation doesn't feel important enough to challenge. 
2. This might happen in situations where I am unsure of the consequences, or I want to avoid confrontation to maintain harmony in relationships.
    
## Aggressive Communication Style in your Day-to-Day Life
1. Aggressive communication happens when I feel frustrated, disrespected, or when I perceive that I am not being heard or valued. 
2. It can occur when I feel my boundaries are being crossed or when I am faced with situations of injustice, where I feel the need to defend myself or stand my ground.
   
## Passive-Aggressive Communication Styles 
1. I tend to switch to passive-aggressive communication when I feel that direct confrontation would not be productive, or when I feel stuck in a situation where expressing my feelings openly feels risky or uncomfortable.
2. This can happen in situations where I may not feel comfortable directly addressing a conflict, such as in social or professional settings.

## Make Your Communication Assertive

2 Express my feelings and needs directly: I would aim to clearly state what I need or feel without being passive or aggressive.
3. Maintain a respectful tone: I would aim to speak with respect and consideration for the other person's perspective, even when expressing my own needs.
