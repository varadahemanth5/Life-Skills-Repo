Active Listening: The listener should pay full attention to the speaker, understanding the message without distractions.
Reflecting Emotions: The listener should recognize and reflect the emotions behind the speaker's words. This shows understanding.
Clarification: If something is unclear, the listener should ask questions what was said to ensure correct understanding.
Verifying the Message: The listener confirms whether they understood the speaker correctly
Mirroring Body Language: Reflective listening involves paying attention to  speaker's body language, helping to show that the listener is engaged and emotionally attuned.
Non-Judgmental Attitude: The listener should avoid jumping to conclusions and allowing the speaker to express themselves freely.

## Question 3 What are the obstacles in your listening process?
Distractions like External noise, like background chatter, phone notifications, can disrupt your focus 
If we have preconceived notions about the speaker or topic, it may affect my ability to listen objectively.
Strong emotions like anger, frustration, or excitement and interfere with your ability to listen calmly and attentively.
Lack of Interest like if the topic doesn't engage it may be difficult to pay attention or retain information.
Interrupting like Jumping in before the speaker has finished can cause you to miss important points  making it harder to understand their message.
Assumptions like Making assumptions about what the speaker is going to say or jumping to conclusions can stop you from fully understanding the message.

## Question 5: When do you switch to Passive Communication Style in your Day-to-Day Life?
I tend to switch to passive communication when I feel that speaking up might cause conflict, or when the situation doesn't feel important enough to challenge. 
This might happen in situations where I am unsure of the consequences, or I want to avoid confrontation to maintain harmony in relationships. 
For example, when dealing with a person in a position of authority, or when there's a power imbalance, I may avoid expressing my opinions or needs directly.

## Question 6: When do you switch into Aggressive Communication Style in your Day-to-Day Life?
Aggressive communication happens when I feel frustrated, disrespected, or when I perceive that I am not being heard or valued. 
It can occur when I feel my boundaries are being crossed or when I am faced with situations of injustice, where I feel the need to defend myself or stand my ground. 
However, I make sure to be mindful of the impact of this communication style on others, as it can sometimes escalate conflicts rather than resolve them.

## Question 7: When do you switch into Passive-Aggressive Communication Styles (e.g., sarcasm/gossiping/taunts/silent treatment) in your Day-to-Day Life?
I tend to switch to passive-aggressive communication when I feel that direct confrontation would not be productive, or when I feel stuck in a situation where expressing my feelings openly feels risky or uncomfortable.
This can happen in situations where I may not feel comfortable directly addressing a conflict, such as in social or professional settings. 
For example, I might use subtle hints or sarcasm when I feel unable to express my feelings honestly or directly at that moment. However, I recognize that this style can be detrimental to relationships, and I try to avoid it.

## Question 8: How Can You Make Your Communication Assertive?
To make my communication more assertive, I would focus on a few key steps:
Express my feelings and needs directly: I would aim to clearly state what I need or feel without being passive or aggressive.
For example, instead of remaining silent or becoming angry, I can calmly and confidently express my thoughts and request what I need.
Maintain a respectful tone: I would aim to speak with respect and consideration for the other person's perspective, even when expressing my own needs. 
Practice active listening: Assertiveness also involves listening to others, understanding their perspective, and then expressing my own needs or feelings clearly and constructively.
Stay calm and composed: I would work on managing my emotions in difficult conversations and try to maintain a calm and clear mind, even when discussing challenging topics.
