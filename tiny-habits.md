# Tiny Habits

## Most Interesting Story: Change the Behavior
1. Old behavior: 
   The calculation was limited to a particular season and only handled one batsman at a time, without allowing for user-driven input.
2. New behavior: 
   Now the calculation is dynamic, allowing users to input a batsman's name and get their strike rate across multiple seasons. 
   Additionally, exclusions for no-ball and wide runs were added to ensure more accurate calculations.

## Change the Environment
1. Old environment: The feature might have been in a static environment where only specific data was accessible.
2. New environment: The environment is now dynamic, allowing for flexible inputs.
## Motivation
1. Personalized analytics: Allowing users to track a batsman's performance year by year.
2. Data exploration: Facilitating deeper insights into batsmen's performance without needing to manually change the code or dataset.
3. Scalability: Making the feature adaptable to different scenarios and users who may want specific seasons or names.

## B = MAP to Make Making New Habits Easier
 This formula is commonly used in habit formation psychology and provides a simple way to design habits by focusing on Behavior (B), Motivation (M), Ability (A), and Prompt (P).
1. M = Motivation: Motivation refers to the internal drive or desire to perform a behavior or habit. It's the why behind the action.  
  How to make habits easier : You want to ensure that your motivation is high when trying to form a new habit.
2. A = Ability: Ability refers to how easy or difficult it is to perform the behavior or habit. The easier it is to do something, the more likely it will become a habit.  
  How to make habits easier: Lower the difficulty of the behavior by simplifying the habit. Start small, making the task so easy that you can't fail.
3. P = Prompt: Prompt refers to a trigger or cue that reminds you to perform the behavior. Without a prompt, the habit might never happen.  
  How to make habits easier : Ensure that your habit has a clear and consistent prompt that reminds you to perform the behavior.

## Behavior = The behavior (B) you want to achieve is dependent on three factors:  
1. Motivation: You need to be motivated enough to do the task.  
2. Ability: The task should be easy enough to do (low difficulty).  
3. Prompt: There should be a clear cue or trigger to remind you to take action.
## Celebrate After Each Successful Completion of Habit
1. Celebrating after completing a habit is crucial because it reinforces positive behavior.  
2. When you celebrate, your brain releases  a feel-good neurotransmitter that makes you want to repeat the action.  
3. This creates a increasing the likelihood of the habit sticking.  
4. Celebrating provides positive reinforcement, which strengthens the neural pathways involved in the behavior.  
5. It helps to associate the habit with pleasure, making it more enjoyable and motivating.  
6. Even small celebrations, like a simple "Well done," can make a big impact over time.  
7. Consistent celebration builds momentum, turning a small habit into a long-term behavior.
   
## Most Interesting Story: Four Stages of Habit Formation
The four stages of habit formation— Noticing ,Wanting ,Doing, and Liking—are interesting to us.
1. Noticing: 
  This is the first stage where you become aware of a specific habit you want to develop or change. It's the initial realization or trigger that sparks interest.
2. Wanting: 
  At this stage, you feel the desire or motivation to perform the action because you see its value. You build the intention to act on it.
3. Doing (Quality vs Quantity): 
  This stage is about the actual action. It's important to focus on quality over quantity. 
4. Liking: 
  As you repeatedly engage in the habit, you start enjoying it. Positive feelings or rewards after completing the action make you more likely to continue and strengthen the habit.
  
## Atomic Habits by James Clear: Identity Plays a Central Role in Habit Formation
1. The book argues that habits are not just behaviors; they are deeply connected to the identity of the person performing them.  
2. The idea is that the most effective way to build lasting habits is to focus on becoming the type of person you want, not just the outcome you desire.  
3. Instead of setting goals like “I want to run a marathon,” Clear suggests focusing on the identity behind it: I am a runner. 
4. When you start viewing yourself as a runner, or as someone who enjoys healthy eating, or as a disciplined person, your habits naturally align with that identity.

## How to Make a Habit Easier to Do
1. Environment Design: Shape your environment so that cues for good habits are more obvious and cues for bad habits are more difficult to find.
2. Implementation Intentions: Set specific plans for when, where, and how you will perform your habits.
3. Start with Small, Easy Wins: By focusing on the smallest possible action, you make it easy to start and build momentum.
4. Habit Stacking: Attach a new habit to an existing one. For example, after you brush your teeth (existing habit), you will meditate for two minutes (new habit). The familiar behavior makes the new behavior easier to remember and initiate.

## How to Make a Habit Harder to Do
1. Increase Friction: The more steps it takes to complete a bad habit, the less likely it will happen. For instance, if you want to watch less TV, you could unplug the TV after each use or put the remote in a difficult-to-reach place.
2. Commitment Devices: Set up external consequences that make it difficult or painful to break your commitments.
3. Social Pressure: Share your goals with others and invite them to hold you accountable.
4. Remove Temptations: Make it harder to access the cues that trigger your bad habits.
   
## How to Make a Habit You Want to Do More of Easier and More Attractive
1. Make the Cue Invisible: Keep our phone in another room while you’re working or during meals so it’s out of sight and you’re not reminded to check it
